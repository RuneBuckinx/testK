The course puts focus on four main topics:

- basics of statistical and machine learning with a focus on the analysis of frequency and severity insurance data
- non-life insurance pricing methods, with GLMs, regression trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines and neural nets: technicalities, interpretation tools and surrogate models, model insights and resulting - pricing models
- credibility theory and bonus-malus scales
- non-life claims reserving.
