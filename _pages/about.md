## About

I am a professor in actuarial science and insurance analytics at KU Leuven and (part-time) professor in actuarial data science with the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. My research lab studies problems in insurance data science. I love teaching at all levels of higher education and enjoy creating engaging materials (e.g., videos, presentations) to share data-driven insights.
